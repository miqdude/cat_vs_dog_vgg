## Using this notebook
* If you are using CPU for training instead of GPU make sure to remove the 'to' method in generate_batches function.
* Since the training of this model was using Google Collab, please take a look at the paramateres such as file path and training parameters in the first cell and second two last cell, you may want to edit them.
